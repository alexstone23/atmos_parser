Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, McGill University, 1992,B.Sc. (Hons.) Astrophysics, Queen's University at Kingston, 1989","Dr. Di Girolamo leads an active research group in remote sensing and radiative transfer. His current research foci lie in the extraction of cloud properties from space, sampling problems inherent to remotely sensed data, and reciprocity principles in three-dimensional radiative transfer. He has extensive experience in working with aircraft and spacecraft remote sensing instruments, including AVHRR, AVIRIS, GMS, GOES, Landsat, MAS, MISR, MODIS, and SSMI. His research has appeared in Applied Optics, Geophysical Research Letters, the Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, the Journal of Geophysical Research, the Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, the International Journal of Remote Sensing, Remote Sensing of Environment, and the IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing. He is currently a co-investigator for the EOS-Terra MISR mission, where he is responsible for developing the cloud detection and classification algorithms needed for standard processing. He is a recipient of the NASA Group Achievement Award for his contribution to the success of the MISR mission. He was also selected under NASAâ€™s New Investigator Program in Earth Science in 2002.,
,Dr. Di Griolamo has served for three years on the AMS Scientific and Technological Activities Commission on Satellite Meteorology and Oceanography, and he has organized, convened, and chaired conference sessions for the AMS and AGU. He has been an editor for the Journal of Applied Meteorology. Dr. Di Girolamo regularly teaches an introductory course in meteorology and advance courses in satellite remote sensing and radiative transfer at the University of Illinois."
